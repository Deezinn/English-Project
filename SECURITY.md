## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please send an email to [security@example.com]. You can expect to receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours. Our team will review the issue and provide a response on whether it will be accepted and fixed.

Once a vulnerability is accepted, we will work on a fix and release a patch as quickly as possible. We will also inform you of the status of the fix and the release date. If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide an explanation and suggest mitigation steps if applicable.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure!
